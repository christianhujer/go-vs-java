# Go vs Java
This repository contains the examples of my meetup talk Go vs Java.
I like both, Go and Java, and I try to be as unbiased as possible.

## POSIX
Package POSIX contains implementations of fundamental programs in C, Go, and Java.
The purpose of this directory is to demonstrate how suited the languages are for developing simple command line tools.
